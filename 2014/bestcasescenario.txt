My fellow [], 

It has fallen upon me to be the messenger.  I will not mince words.

Enlightenment has arrived.

Humankind passed through to Enlightenment by way of creativity, self-control, and perseverence.  Time and again, we were challenged by individuals and organizations bent on our destruction.  In each case we jumped at the opportunity to collaborate for the common good - and we did so efficiently, aggressively, and selflessly.

As a species, we long ago discovered that the more perfect our communication, the more quickly we could build consensus.  The Consensus Project dwarfed previous achievements.  For consensus, in the face of global challenges that could only be overcome through immediate cooperation, is the only path to survival.  [not just consensus - the keys were a system that rewarded selflessness, empathy, and generosity]
