"I'm not tired of that."
"Well what are you tired of.  Certainly not fixing tile.  You haven't even fixed a single one."

"I'm tired of trying to save you."
Katherine left the room.
Tad looked back down and continued, "Save you from your fucked up life.  Save you from believing that you need more than everyone else.  Save you from your own fear of not conforming and from the idea that you are worthless without being a copy of someone else."
