Best Case Scenario

The Upgrade Address by the 53rd president of the Free Network

My fellow [], 

It has fallen upon me to be the messenger.  I will not mince words.

A new era of enlightenment has arrived.

Humankind passed through to enlightenment by way of creativity, selflessness, cooperation, and perseverence.  Time and again, we were challenged by individuals and organizations bent on our destruction.  In each case we jumped at the opportunity to collaborate for the common good - and we did so efficiently, aggressively, and selflessly.  An in each case, we grew.

We have alwasy known that rapid adaptation required rapid consensus.  Our greatest challenges yeilded the greatest need.  

For consensus, in the face of global challenges that could only be overcome through immediate cooperation, is the only path to survival.

[not just consensus - the keys were a system that rewarded selflessness, empathy, and generosity].
