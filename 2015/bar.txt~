Dale had that kind of headache that you could barely feel.  Mostly it was that kind because it traveled with a raging buzz born of an epic party the night before.  He had to admit, as he stared at the gouged and grimy bar through his beer, that he was still pretty drunk.  Or maybe high.  He really didn't remember well enough to say for sure.  That realization alone sobered him a little.  He remembered getting up this morning, head pounding.  Then rolling out of bed and making his way down to the street the block or two from here.  When he saw the door open, he came into the lonely, narrow, dim place, it's first customer.

Thoughts came.  "How did I get into that hotel?  That was a dump.  Bet I've got fleas.  All this thinking is making my head hurt.  Talkin to myself doesn't help."

His headache moved and morphed, and ended up parking itself above his right eye, as usual.  Finding it's home, it settled in, and began the work of expanding in intensity.  

There really is no proper analogy for a good, solid headache.  It's pain, plain and simple.  Pain that plants itself somewhere, and grows.  The mind reacts as it will.  Sometimes the mind is prepared, strong, fighting smart.  Sometimes it's tired, beaten down, near panicked, and hallucinating.  Sometimes the mind is so resigned or occupied that even a painful headache becomes background noise.  Dales mind, sitting somewhere between confused and depressed, decided that it would take an old, beaten path.  Internally, he rationalized the pain as a masochist would, and as he drew in a sip of beer, welcomed it.

"Ahhh...bring it on.", Dale said aloud.

"Amen to that, brother.", a voice replied from down the bar.

His head swiveled a few dozen degrees to the left, and his beer hand lowered, but his body stayed in place, leaned forward at the same angle, as if it were stone.

A dark silhouette sat at the far end of the bar, bright light streaming around it from the open door.  Dale recognized the voice, but all he got out of the image was blind.  He shaded his eyes with his beer hand.

"I know you?", Dale asked.

"Well, I hope, so, brother!", said the blurry silhouette surrounded by firey eye spikes, "We're roommates!"

Dale looked back down to his beer and saw the silhouette of a fat man on top of it.  He rubbed his eyes with his palms.  He had decided maybe he didn't recognize the voice, and that even if he did, he didn't want to have anything to do with it, if his experience with it thus far was any indication of future performance.  The worst part of the unfortunate conversation to Dale was the fact that it had completely screwed up his previously healthy masochistic disposition toward his headache. 

"I don't have a roommate", Dale mumbled, still rubbing his eyes, "or a brother."

"You were a lot friendlier in the hospital.", the stranger said.

The hair stood up on the back of Dales neck.  Memories unwelcome and unsure flooded into his mind.  

The party he had been invited to the night before went south when the Tequila came out.  The host, a retiring but highly respected administrator at the local university, had poured king-sized shots of the strongest stuff that had ever passed Dales lips - for toast after toast.  He had never seen a geology student punch a professor like that, or a mathematician take on a plumber over a minor philosophical point with a cutting board to the gut.  When sherrif had arrived, he was feeling pretty smug, having positioned himself at the top of the stair, well away from the melee, propped against a wall for balance, but with a birds eye view of the chaos.  When the sherriff arrived and panic struck, he was thrown forward in the wave of humanity.  Partygoers, as unaccustomed with the law as they were with their level of insobriety, rushed to leave, hoping to , rushed the door, knocking Dale down the stairs and into a pile of chaos consisiting of the cursing, confused, injured, and sick.

"Oh, yeah.  I don't really remember much about the hospital.", Dale said.
