The boys legs were folded under him like he was kneeling, but they didn't look right.  His back was against the trench wall - drop of wet blood at the corner fo his mouth.

The old man passed his canteen over, and the boy took a sip, weakly.  Then a few more.

"You look like death warmed over."

The boy coughed.

"Gas."

"Most people I run into out here got caught in it.", the old man said, "I'm sorry."

The boy stole sips when wasn't talking.

"They all dead?", the boy said.

The man looked down.

"Yeah."

"Nothing <cough> to be done, then."

"No."

There was a long pause, and the man drew out a leatherbound notebook from his bag, and a pen.  Then he lifted his head with a gentle smile.

"Well, I better get your story.", he said.

The boy took another sip, staring at a patch of sky he could see above the curving trench wall across from him.

"Why would I tell you that?", the boy asked.

"Got something better to do?"

"I guess I need a reason...don't you?"

"Ain't no reason, young man.  I just know that I'm supposed to do this.  You game?"

"You gonna write down what I say, huh."

"Yeah."

"It'll end up in the ground, just like you and me."

"Yeah."

"Probably be dead before you finish it."

"No one gets out of here alive, young man.  Everyone in this valley is right behind you, hasn't gone already."

A while passed.  The old man sat on an ammo crate, with his notepad and pen ready, waiting.  The young man just coughed, sipped, and struggled with pain.

"I miss my wife.", the young man said at last.  "Marie.  I'm glad she left me, but I loved her."

A tear tried to form at his eye as he continued.  "It's the way of the world.  Never put me in the right place.  I was always misunderstood.  You get that, old man?"

"Got it."

"If the lord put me in with different people, maybe.", the boy paused for a sip.  "You get that much?"

"Everyones misunderstood.  We all are, far as I can tell.", the old man said.

"I loved the guitar.  Could have been good.  If I were in the right place, right time.", the boy said, then paused, and grimaced as his body did something to him.  "Old man, I don't have any more words.", he said finally.

"That's o.k.", the man said.

The boy rested awhile again, then coughed for a while, then spoke.  "The CP.  Back there.  They got a guitar.  If you care to find it.  Got nothing better to do.  I would...'preciate it.

"Got nothing else.", the old man said.

"If you can put it in my hands, I can pick it."

"My honor.", the old man said, "Be right back."

The old man disappeared for a while.  When he returned, he was holding a beaten black guitar case, covered in mud, but still latched closed.  He set it down and opened it, and let out a whistle when he saw it unbroken.

Alex's eyes were closed.  He looked like he was gone.  The old man just frowned and kept to task.

It took him a minute to arrange Alex's arms, so that they could cradle the instrument, put his hands on the strings the way he thought they should be, pulling a little a muscle or a bone here or there, until it looked just right - just like they used to hold them when they played back home.

The boys eyes, once holding the instrument, winced, then opened, his head tilted down, and he smiled.

Alex played the last thing he would play before he died.  The depth of feeling welled up in him like a red sun, and from it came a song like a calm ocean - irresistable waves of gentle music that held his life and his death in each verse.

The old man just sat there with his notepad and pen, helpless.

When Alex was gone, he closed his eyes.  He packed up the guitar with one of his dog tags, and left the other on Alex, then moved on.
