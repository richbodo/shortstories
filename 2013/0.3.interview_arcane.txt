Probably a great place to intro manny as a young man - 15 years prior.

[This interview will go completely differently.  People are scared.  They're freaked out.  They're trying to get money to make it out.  They are scheming.  It's mostly automated, but it's a very different profile of conversation.  The super-creepy Arcane Air Force is in the conversation, just being weird and freaking the fuck out of people.  Someone makes a side bet that the voice is simply there to prey on our fears.]
