maybe janet tries to get past another drone.  she can get some stuff out of the case that is given to her to reprogram an automated bicycle, and finds that she has control of the whole cities automated bicycles - then drives them into the mech all at once, and runs them off the road, causing the mech to chase them down and let her by.

*** need a flashback inbetween this and the first part of the janet intro  - needs to be fun and establish janet and bruce as bad-ass experts ****

*** janet sees a bunch of homeless people on the streets.  the one guy with his head in his arms, leaning against a storage bin, the guy passed out in blankets.  they dont' know.  later, arlington will pick these guys up ***

Long ago, Klamath was a logging town, with a small airbase and medical school as the only other job centers.  When logging began to want, it became an agricultural center.  Then, when DARPA set up a lab here, it became one of those odd military towns that employed a unique blend of scientists and military personelle.  Through each transition, it had seen a boom and bust, reflected in the eclectic layout of the town.  The town was currently in a bust, with the Klamath Falls Defense Research Center downsizing, the town was losing it's middle class again.  Many of the businesses were vacant.  She passed fancy office buildings, fine restaurants, seedy motels, dollar stores and empty buildings with boarded up, broken windows.  With the boom and bust economy, most of downtown Klamath replaced its windows every 20 years.

Janet knelt outside the quick-e-mart for a long time, staring at her phone on the ground.  Eventually, sorrow and anxiety loosened their grip on her conscious mind - a kind of hopless determination began to set in.  

Biosafe buildings were sealed by now.  Any building with a modern door would have automatically locked and delegated control of it's systems to a government authority.  Without a plan, and with all government buildings locked down, Janet sought the only person she knew would help her.  She headed home.  She hoped Bruce would be waiting for her.

In the first few minutes of her journey, she heard flyers of some kind overhead.  She saw a few auto-autos driving by at high speed, and even caught a glimpse of a few people running in the distance.  But after fifteen minutes or so, she heard only the wind and the muted roar of distant jets.  Every building that was bio-sealed was dark.  Every building that was not sealed was locked and empty as far as Janet could tell.

Halfway home, she turned onto Klamath Ave, as usual, to cross the narrow canal there. She saw something big shining in the road ahead, below the highway 97 overpass.  As she approached the intersection of Klamath ave and Main from the west, the objects in the road resolved themselves.  

Neat lines of tire spikes and two-meter-tall nanosteel pillars rose from the street, closing off all four directions of travel to autos below the freeway.  That wouldn't stop her.  She pressed on, slowly, half-drunk with emotional strain and all nerves with the appearance of the lockdown.

When Janet was only a block away from the canal, the ground began to shake.  Janet stopped to look around her as the buildings themselves seemed to rumble and groan.  The asphalt of the intersection on the other side of the canal cracked and gave.  The overpass began to bulge upward.

With a great screech of motors, metal, and shattering stone, four robotic members of the Klamath first robotic anti aircraft wing rose smoothly and slowly from the center of the intersection of Klamath and Main...and continued to rise.  At the same time, the overpass above the robots lifted like a drawbridge, making way for the giants.

When the huge, boxy machines reached full-height, they spun and raised weapons and antennae, a full three stories above the street, dwarfing Janet like mythical guardians.  The machines, "Mechs" as Bruce called them, were painted with the bright colors of their unit, as if to say, "Friend and enemy, we are the law, and we want you to know this."

Janet froze in her tracks a dozen steps from the mechs, and stumbled to one knee, coughing from the dust.

Janet had traveled over that slightly raised intersection thousands of times when traversing Klamath.  She knew on some level that it was a military substation of some kind, but she never expected to see this.

Unfortunately for Janet, her destination, her home, lay on the other side of the canals that split western Klamath from the rest of the small city.  There were only three automobile bridges in Klamath, and all three had the "bulges" that were now defense systems.  

Janets mind sobered and raced in the face of the behemoths.  These machines scared her so much she hardly dared move, but the longer she stayed outside the more likely she would contract a bio or nanobot infection.  The sooner she got home the sooner she could get help from Bruce and help Maureen and the kids.

Janet didn't want to get close to the machines, but it looked like there was room for a human to fit in between the spikes, pillars, and robots.  This system must be designed to allow small things through, if they were friendly.  If the robots didn't care about her, or if they viewed her as a friend, she could make it.

She decided to wait a minute or so before approaching.  This turned out to be a good idea.  Those *were* arms behind their back.  The "Mechs" began performing systems tests - moving like lightning, they swung their arms and weaponry through its range of motion while rotating their bodies in place, shattering great chunks of asphalt that had scattered when they rose, throwing rocks that hit Janet - hard.  Then they fell silent.  Enough dust rose again that it caused Janet to cough.  She waited.

Janet could see weapons systems pointing skyward from the top of the things.  One of the weapons, a cylinder about 12 feet long, swiveled down quickly and smoothly, tracking something in the distance.  She could hear the screech of automobile tires from the direction the weapon was pointing.  A fast-moving auto a few blocks away, perhaps.  The auto must not have been a threat.  The weapon returned to it's original position.

Janet took a few deep breaths.  looked at the picture of Maureen on her cell phone.  She advanced on the mechs.

A dozen steps away Janet stopped in her tracks and glared at the robots as if they were very rude and unfair boys, and steeled herself.  Then she took a deep breath, and approached the nearest mech straight on.  At three meters distance, two chainguns chattered as they swiveled, loaded, and lit Janets body up with laser light.  A single word boomed in the voice of a speech synthesyzer that Janet recognized.  "IDENTIFY!" 

"Janet Li", said Janet in a frail voice, holding one arm up as if to block the bullets.  

Again the word boomed: "IDENTIFY!"

This is the end, she thought.  Her eyes scanned about uselessly.  There was no escape.  Janet used the only thing she had, her cell phone, and held it up to the robots, as if they would take it in lieu of her life.  Her cell phone arm outstretched, and as high as she could manage above her tiny, bent figure, her head turned away, her eyes closed tight...she awaited the inevitable.  

She saw none of what happened next.  A whine of mechatronic machinery as a mechanical arm whipped from behind the nearest mech, a three-pronged hand reaching out, so large and quick that the wind blew Janets her hair back.  Three extended fingers, each the size of her ten-yearold grand-daughter, covered in sensors, stopped a foot away from her body.  The sensors surrounded her, and coated Janet in visible laser light.

Then, nothing happened.

The inevitable never came.  Janet peeked open an eye. Her cell phone was almost touching the center of that giants hand.  She was completely disoriented, and remained perfectly still, her brow furrowed, her heart in her throat.  Seconds passed.

Then mechs massive arm drew back so quickly Janet was almost pulled off her feet by the wind it created.  The arm rotated unnaturally as it withdrew, reaching into the side of the robot opposite it, and pausing there.  Janet made a small, frightened noise, and breathed heavily, unsure of what to do.

The arm quickly returned, to a position directly in front of Janet, this time holding a metal box about the size of a briefcase, and placing it on the ground in front of her.  Janet stole a glance down at the box, and then the arm was gone.

"GSA 5734512324, retired.  Lee, Janet."  long pause.  "You have been activated in service of Klamath Falls Air National Guard.  Report to Jackson Air Base immediately."

She couldn't quite place the emotion that drove her to talk back to this deadly machine.  Some instinct learned on her way up the government ladder must have kicked in.  "I...Identify!", replied Janet.

"AA Mech 9742345-61", the mech bellowed.

"AA Mech 9742345-61..."

A red light shown on the mechs chest.  Whatever it meant, Janet took that as a warning.  It might know her limits and may not respond kindly to a QA Director, however high level, wasting it's time.

"...Thank you.  N-nice to meet you?"

"Report to Jackson Air Base immediately!" The Mech retorted.

"O.k!", Janet said.  She quickly pocketed her cell phone and stared down at the box the mech had placed in front of her.  Jackson air base was miles away, in the opposite direction of home.  She wasn't sure she coud walk there.  Without this giant box.  Was she supposed to take it?

"Am I supposed to take this box?", She asked.

No reponse.  

Janet began the laborious process of dragging the white box to the side of the road.  She had to use both hands and there was no way she could lift the thing, but she did get it up the curb, somehow, after a minute of hard work.  She sat upon it, breathing heavily, and observed the Mechs.  Antennae had begun to rotate atop them, scanning the sky.  The mechs were otherwise silent.  Sitting began to feel good again.  She closed her eyes.

Janet had just begun to calm herself down when an explosion in the distance jolted her.  

At the same moment, all four defense mechs began turning in place and firing some sort of machine guns at a point in the distant sky, deafening her.  Instinctively, she covered her ears with both hands, shut her eyes tight, and lowered her head.  As soon as it had begun, it was over.  

She looked up, breathing heavily, adrenaline pumping.  The mechs were silent.  The only evidence that anything had happened was a cloud of smoke rising above the silent AA mechs, presumably discharged from their weapons.  She forced herself to breath steadily.  Told herself to calm down. 

She desperately wanted to be home.  Jackson air base was behind her.  Her home on the other side of these mechs.  //Jackson air base may not be a bad option.  They might let me contact Bruce.//, she thought to herself.  She stared down at the nondescript box she was seated on.

"How do I open this thing?", she asked herself.

It didn't turn out to be hard once she found the two recessed, heavy duty latches.  The top of the case opened with a slight pop when she flipped the latches, seperating half an inch at the seam.  With great effort, Janet opened the top the rest of the way, letting it slam on the ground.  The case contained about a dozen dark green boxes, of different shapes and sizes, numbered and neatly fit into each side of the case.  

Huds with old-school earpieces were embedded in foam on the top left half of the case, with a neckband attached.  Vintage military stuff, probably 20 or 30 years old, same as those Mechs.  Janet pulled out a water bottle and read the instructions, turned it on, and pocketed it.  She put a dehydrated meal and something called a "biosafe blanket" in the pocket containing her cell phone and the leatherman.  Janet seated the HUDS on her face, the neckband around her head, and the earpieces in her ears.  She closed the case and sat back down on it.  As nervous as she was, it felt great to sit down.

After thirty minutes of frustrating experimentation, Janet began to feel the huds were useless for anything other than deadening noise and possibly deflecting bugs.  They were tactical things.  Janet didn't have the equipment required to debug them.  

She played with them a little more and determined they would allow her to zoom and store/retrieve images and audio.  They would also deaden loud noises to a safe level, and amplify and record any noise she so designated.  She ran her fingers over the bug-eyed, thick matte-black frames, and along the black cables that led to the earbuds.  Perhaps they would convey another advantage.  Surely something at Klamath air base was tracking them by now.   Why hadn't they sent a flyer out to meet her?  Eight miles at fifty miles an hour.  She looked at the time.

"They should be here.", she said to herself.

Then again, she thought, she had been present at demonstrations of military monitoring systems in the past.  She remembered training sessions with the air force.  The technicians were overwhelmed when there was no war going on, usually cancelling low priority alerts, if they saw them at all.  The peer-to-peer monitoring networks were a little better, but a lost, untrained QA director wouldn't rate a single alert, never mind incorporation into a massive group of collaborating peers.  Unless someone had programmed a computer to do watch her, it wasn't getting done.  Resources, especially human resources, were scarce at times like this.  Janet wasn't raised to curse, but she silently fumed at the monitoring team.

She pulled up a map on her phone.  Eight hours at her average walking speed to Klamath Air Base.  Five hours to walk north, across the footbridge over the canal at Conger park (if it wasn't blocked by a monstrous robot of some kind), and back into town and south to her home.

A river cut through Klamath, and Janet was on the wrong side of the river from everything.  

----- *** at this point, need to change the geographic structure - I like the steep road idea, but need to work it in - also need to make sure Janet has good reason to avoid passing the mechs - perhaps that jackson air base is not past them.  *** ----

She stared at the map despondently, tracing the routes to the Air Base, scanning her side of the river for any building that was biosafe.  The closest obviously government run building was nondescript but large.  The route to that building led south four blocks, then along an otherwise unused road she had never traveled.  [name of road].  It led away from the river, into the hills about a mile.  This was possibly the only road she had not traveled in Klamath.  She had seen military vehicles cross the intersection of that road and Main, on their way to Klamath Air Base.  A storage facility?  Manned?  Possibly!  She had seen a driver in at least one of those vehicles.  Yes!  It wouldn't be easy, but she could make it there.  She put the phone away and searched through the white box for more medicine and food, then started out toward the building.

-------

As she rounded the corner she heard the muted blast of another volley from the AA mechs, followed by multiple explosions.  The HUDs did their job to keep the volume to a low level.  Still, she flinched, ducked a bit, and picked up her pace, without looking back. 

By the time she reached the corner of Main and [name of road] she was already winded.  The water bottle had grown too big for her left pocket, and the meal in her right pocket had caused her hip to act up.  She removed them, drank what water had been gathered from the air by the bottle, and sat down.  The streets were empty.  She heard the muted sound of jets, but no explosions.  She reached out to the audio controls overlaid by her huds on her view of the gutter, and played back the last five minutes of audio at half volume corrected to her compass perspective. The jets were flying away from Klamath Air Base.  Nothing flying traveled in the direction of [name of road] as far as she could tell.  Her hip hurt tremendously.  

She sat silently, staring down.  For a moment, she avoided looking up at [name of road], knowing how steep it was, and despairing.  She hadn't climbed a road that steep in 10 years.  She took out her phone, looking at the map again.  Stalling.  It was no use.  It was by far the closest biosafe building she could make it to, even taking into account how steep the road was.  There was nothing else she could make by nightfall.  When the map closed, her messages shown.  Maureens face stared back at her, full of knowing love.

"I'm coming baby.", she said.

She stood, water bottle and meal in either hand, and stared down [name of road], stared right through it, filled it with determination until it dissipated into nothingness.  Then she set out.

-----

Sweating profusely, mechanically walking through the pain in her hip and, unusually, her left ankle.  She stopped many times, only long enough to catch a few breaths.  Despite her determination, it was an emotional climb.  Two hours later, she crested the top of the hill.

In the distance she could see the [hills] covered in redwoods.  The sun was beginning to set.  Oak and redwoods lined the downward length of [name of road], the trees and curves hiding her final destination from her.  She zoomed in and scanned the woods in the direction of her final destination.  It was a valley, and the road descended along a natural ravine.  The descent would be as steep as the climb, but thankfully, far shorter.  She allowed herself a momentary break.  Long enough to put down what she was carrying.  She was unsteady, almost out of energy.  She removed her HUDs to clean her forehead and the huds themselves of sweat and water vapor.  The pain in her ankle flared up.  She must have injured it in the climb.  She knew she had to get back into regular movement again, or the pain would take over.  She turned off audio completely to avoid the sound of her own breath and began a methodical descent, mechanically drinking water and scanning for signs of buildings.  
A few hundred meters down the road, the hills rose steeply on either side, what scrubby foliage there was, was cleanly shaven to a few inches from the rock faces.

Janet saw white through the trees as she rounded a bend.  Her heart rose.  Finally!! She walked as if in a dream.  The road led steeply down toward the white building, almost half as steeply as the hills rose to her sides.  Finally she was facing the building.

Her heart fell.  The wall in front of her was twelve feet tall, studded with weapons across the top, and sported visible tracks where it met the road.  The giant white machine in front of her was like a mobile roadblock, with wing-like metallic extensions that actually dug into the rock walls at it's sides.  Nothing that walked or rolled was getting past it.

"IDENTIFY"

If anything, this mech was much larger and more intimidating than the mechs that had cut off the bridge.  But Janet was too tired to be scared.  Exhausted, she put down what she was carrying and pulled out her cell phone, holding it up to the mech.

Nothing happened. 

"Hello?" Janet asked finally, "Janet Lee?  GSA 5734512324 here, Janet Lee."

She interrogated the mech in this manner several times.  No response.  

"It worked last time." she said aloud. "Why aren't you people watching!"

She put her hands on her knees.  She was wobbly, and tired.  She tried to ignore the pounding pain in her ankle.  Too tired to be upset, and all cried out, her mind turned to survival.

It was getting dark.  She knew she needed food and shelter, but she had few options.  

She found enough room to sit on the side of the road a couple feet from the roadblock.  She sat in the dirt with her back to a mossy wall of dirt and rock.  Partly reclined, she gave the massive Road Mech the evil eye.  

It was sunset, but the trees overhanging the road allowed enough light through that she could pull the biosafe blanket from it's package, and, with some effort, read the instructions.  

[funny military biosafe blanket instructions - include bit about nervous system damage that almsot all military chemicals provide]

Pulled in her knees, covered herself in the otherwise useless red blanket, drank what water her bottle had collected, chewed on a ration, allowed herself to lean way back into the wall, and soon passed out.

When she woke, she was cold.  The sun had risen, but little warmth passed through the trees to her.  Her ankle and her legs ached to no end.  Testing moving her left leg a few inches, her head shook with pain.  She pulled the blanket away.  It looked like a baseball had been added to her left ankle.  She wasn't going anywhere.

She looked at the robot, then back at her ankle, then at the robot again.  This robot had to be bristling with sensors.  

She picked up a rock and threw it at the robot.  It barely hit the metallic side, and bounced off.  She threw another at the tracks.  Missed.  She threw another, and another.  It wasn't a great plan, but it felt good.  

She threw another, harder this time.

***** This whole section needs a lot of work *****



<maybe cut or rewrite this paragraph>

The robotic machines, fully deployed, were about the size of a very large truck stood on one end, what might be arms behind what might be their backs.  Some equipment where a head would be, scanning the sky, otherwise motionless.  That's where the humanoid analogy ended.  Bruce would call these "Mechs".  Janet had tried to learn as little as possible about robotics and Bruce's work, but she knew it was likely he was involved in designing at least some part of these monstrosities.  She also knew they were quite capable of defending themselves from hundreds of approaching air and ground units.
