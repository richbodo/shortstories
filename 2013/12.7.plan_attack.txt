bruce and janet go to work at the motor pool. 

arlington is sent to do something else, but when he returns, he has a crazy mission and modded vehicle.  he's blown away.

janet and bruce are struggling to finish mods to a vehicle and figure out how to drive it.  arlington brings out something much better and finishes the job.

the new extraskin needs a few hours to learn about bruce, it has to tap into his nervous system.  the old extraskin had to plug into military implants, but they stopped doing that.

they say their goodbyes.
