  
Paul was trying to calculate the capsules trajectory, but he couldn't stop
thinking about his legs.  He couldn't feel them.  He couldn't feel anything.



His mind compensated for the lack of sensation with images and sounds and
feelings that weren't there - in frightening detail.



He was aware of the sound of his own breath.  That, he could focus on.  



He could still see the stars, the universe, passing by.



It was hard to measure time - in stasis, it didn't matter - it may as well
have stopped.



He wondered what his family would be told.  
  
\------  
  
After a standard month, Paul realized that he was leaving the system.  He
wasn't headed anywhere near home.  Escape pods could not bend space.  Emotions
dominated him.  Soon, all he had left was grief.  He could no longer hear the
sound of his breathing - only the sounds his mind recalled - sounds worth
grieving over.  
  
\------  
  
A year later, he met Roger.  Paul had always known, somewhere deep down, that
Roger was a part of him.  Roger introduced him to the star maps and the
physics that Paul had learned in school.  Paul showed Roger the memory palaces
that he had built.  Together they spent the days and nights.  
  
\------  
  
After ten years adrift, after uncovering most things that Paul had experienced
and learned, and almost everything Roger had known, after building a city
together, they found a way to bring more people in.



That was when their first great argument occurred.  Roger knew that to add
people to their world, Paul would have to close down entire palaces, lose
great sections of the city, the beauty and the detail that had taken so long
and given them such happiness.  
  
Paul, in simple whites, stood on the walkway between the imperial palace and
library, and stared out through the transparent glass, at the universe in
motion.  
  
Roger, his silk robes embroidered with geometric constants flowing behind him,
hurried down the walkway to join Paul.  They loved to meet here.  
  
"You know we will have to lose things.  Some things forever.", Roger reasoned.  
"I have to take that chance, Roger.", said Paul with a smile, looking to the
stars.  
"We still have so much we can build.  We have done so much research.  We're
making real progress."  
"We're lonely Roger.  Not just me.  You need more than this."  
"I don't!  I have everything I need here with you.  The life of the mind is
the only truly happy life.  I still believe that!"  
"I don't."  
"We can still imagine them."  
"Imagination is not the same as reality, Roger.  I still remember what they
were like.  My wife.  My children."  
"They won't be the same.  You know that.  Not even close.  We can have the
best of all possible worlds, here.  A perfect world."  
"I don't know, Roger.  Even here, I'm not sure we have that much control.",
Paul said.  
"I am certain."  
  
Paul said nothing.  They just stood there for a while, both knowing.  
  
"I won't lose my research, Paul...I can't...it's too important.  More
important than me...", Roger strained to keep the tears back.  
"...more important than you.", Roger said.  
"When there is a tiger above, and a tiger below...lets play a game.", Paul
said, turning to Roger and smiling.  "Soon enough, I'll set out.  I'll stay as
far from the research as I can."  
"Take the city down, but don't touch the research...", Roger said, tears
rolling down his cheeks.  
  
Paul said nothing, but with gestures, arranged the most complicated and
intricate multi-dimensional game he and Roger had ever played.  Rogers heart
wasn't in it, but he excelled at the kind of math involved.  It was an epic
battle that lasted months, and lifted their spirits.  At times they were
laughing or whooping or straining with effort.  But eventually, Roger
prevailed.  In the end, the victory was infinitely hollow, for Roger knew it
merely marked the end of a great affair.  
  
\------  
  
A hundred standard years into their journey, Roger had a breakthrough.  He ran
to the walkway to tell Paul, but his heart sank, for he knew where Paul was.
He teleported to the sub-basement of the research facility, and turned on the
lights.  
  
Paul, in his teardrop-shaped escape capsule, blankly stared out through the
extensive viewport.  
  
Roger had engineered a finer stasis system than any that had come before.  In
a second capsule, Pauls wife, or something like her, stared straight ahead as
well.  
  
"I did it Paul.", Roger said.  
"I had to tear down most of the city to do it.  I still have the palace...",
Roger said as he slumped against the far wall.  
"The equations were staggering.  But I know now.  I know where we are.  I know
where we are going.  Some place real.  A place that this capsule will bring
life to!  By the time we get there, I may know how to get us home, Paul."  
"You know it was worth it.  You know what this means!  We're close, Paul.  To
a real life!"  
  
Rogers eyes moved to his feet.  
  
"I know you won't understand.  I couldn't let her bring another mind into this
world.  She was so much bigger than we thought."  
Roger lifted his head to the other capsule, his hand to his chin,
contemplating.  
"I know now that I can get us home, Paul...you'll forgive me...then."  
Roger dimmed the lights, and, slowly, began to construct the next stage of his
research facilities, each nut, bolt, and equation, taking a piece of Pauls
wife with it, until Paul lay next to an empty capsule.  Soon, even that
dissapeared.  
  
\------  
  
A thousand years in, Paul began to understand his situation.  He did not know
what journey he was on.  But he saw it for what it was: A journey of constant
change, of destruction.  He could see the past and the future as a single
path, and he began to let go.  
  
As he did so, he began to step outside himself.  He recognized sensation for
what it was.  
  
His mind and his consciousness fell asunder of their own accord.  
  
\------  
  
A million years into their journey, Roger paid Paul another visit.  
  
"I've made progress, Paul."  
"I have ten times the memory capacity we thought possible.  I could bring back
the crude facsimile you imagined of your wife and kids, theoretically."  
  
"There's only one problem..." Roger said, "I have better uses for that space."  
  
"You wouldn't believe how many people I've created and destroyed in all these
millenia.  Or maybe you would.  I know you've been thinking in there.  I've
certainly got my flaws, I've come to realize.  I've enjoyed these years...but
I don't let bad habits get in the way of productivity.", Roger flipped on the
lights.  
  
This time, Roger appeared as a giant white insect.  
  
"I've been tempted dissemble you, believe me, but I've left you largely in-
tact. You didn't need most of that body, as it turns out."  
Roger pressed a white, mantis-like face against the pod next to Paul.  "No one
plays the game like you, though.", he said menacingly.  
  
Roger paced in front of Paul.  
  
"Well, I'll level with you.  It's taking me some time to reclaim your mind.
You've got a grip on that thing that defies logic.", Roger said.  
  
"So, I have a fittingly illogical appeal.  See this.", Roger said, and a timer
appeared in front of Paul. "You have this much time to let go of a few
memories for me.  That will be the signal.  Once I have them, I will create a
facsimile of your wife and children, living in joy.  You will continue to
release your memories, and I will keep your family running.  A million years
of joy, in exchange for your mind.  A few images for you." Images of Pauls
family at their happiest played before him. "Think on it."  
  
Roger dissolved into the background.  He reappeared on the imperial walkway,
staring at the starscape.  
  
In another million years, they would land in the system as he had projected.
The pod would attempt to seed the planet, helping life along, if it did not
exist.  By Rogers calculations, it just might work.  
  
With luck, by the time the capsule was opened, he would know how to build what
was needed.  
  
Elena appeared, and took his hand.  
"Interesting times." Roger said to Elena.  
"Indeed, your majesty.", Elena said.  
  
They looked out over the bustling city.  Rogers subjects were legion, although
a crude simulation at a distance.  
  
Elena was the first that Roger made wholly independent.  A genius in her own
right, developing her own experiences, theories, and emotions.  She aided
Roger with his research and served as the ideal companion.  
  
The escape pod rounded the star system, and entered approach mode, slowing and
adjusting its course into orbit over the most suitable planet.  It was
spectacular.  After one hundred million years, the pod appeared to function
exactly as designed - focused energy softening its landing in a large body of
water.  They celebrated.  The world was indeed an ideal place to land.



\-----------



Millenia passed.  
  
Fate provided the pod with a view of the roiling skies of the planet, the
splashing waves of it's oceans.  This was the time of great risk.  They could
do nothing more to support intelligent life on this planet.  
  
Roger worked away with Elena to measure the skies and calculate their fate,
though they knew they were helpless to do anything but watch.  
  
Fear took its toll.  Without Elena, Rogers sufferring would have been
intolerable.  The excitement outside made it entirely impossible to
concentrate on his research.  
  
Elena kept him focused, and to the extent that he could, Roger loved her.
Their attachment grew deep.  
  
The pod struck an object, became buried, and stayed buried for millions of
years.  
  
A break in the black sky grew.  Then two, and dozens of cracks, spreading out
over the sky - grasping tendrils that sprouted tendrils, encompassing the
world.  Life.  
  
\-------  
  
Pauls awareness continued to grow.  He was able to explore and understand his
biological structure.  His mind became a transparent thing, a thing he could
see and feel.  He studied it's movements.  He watched it think.  Any thought
could be observed, or controlled.  He understood their genesis at a
fundamental level.  
  
\-------  
  
One hundred million years later, Roger was ready.  His knowledge of
mathematics and physics now far exceeded that of the society that had trained
him.  He had prepared and tested his designs.  He knew how to bend space.



Roger dominated this mind, but only Paul had ever controlled the Body.  Roger
had learned to generate sympathetic brain waves that could be used to control
his Body once released.  He had no need for Paul.  When the capsule opened, he
would take control of this Body, and begin his real work.  
  
A dominant life form had emerged on the planet - humans - they had interacted
with the capsule.  Roger began to study them.  He and Elena taught their
children, Astara and Hope, the primitive languages the humans spoke.  
    
Astara and Hope were fascinated by the humans.  
  
The humans were so similar, but so primitive - a source of humor for the
children.  The children were fascinated with the "universe" outside of the
"Body", and spent very little of their time observing the "realm" which Roger
had created.  
  
Roger had no patience for the humans.  They were frustratingly stupid.  Only
the love of his family kept him from going completely mad as he awaited their
advancement.  
  
Displayed in the private collection of the humans largest religion, the escape
pod containing Roger was shown to religious scientists and philosophers.  
  
Roger learned their politics, how they controlled one another.  After each
war, the capsule changed hands, each tribe putting Roger in front of its best
and brightest, until one tribe, more advanced than the others, dominated.  
  
Once the Americans had the capsule in the Eugene laboratory, Roger knew it was
time.  They had mastered fusion, they understood the barrier that they were
dealing with in the stasis field.  
  
Then the day came.  
  
The American humans assigned keeping Roger alive their highest priority.  Most
of their precautions were unnecessary, some of them harmful, but Roger
believed they would be successful.  
  
Roger had built a great mall in anticipation of the event.  Seating for his
subjects, with appropriate and massive statuary around the mall, had been
erected.  
  
A floating cathedral for Roger and his family, high above his subjects, was
protected by an energy field.  Roger had given all of his subjects the power
of flight for this new, highly anticipated phase of their lives.  
  
He and his family held hands as the stasis field was pounded again and again,
ultimately shattering.  The stasis field disabled, the pod began it's opening
process.  
  
Humans and their machines waited with weapons and instruments trained.  The
scientists charged with reanimating Roger were as anxious as Roger and his
family were, gripping the arms of their chairs tightly.  
  
All at once, the pod began to change.  The transparent material of it's front
melted away.  
  
The empire watched as the sky they had always looked upon shimmered.  All
waited to see how Roger would interact with the humans, the wisdom he would
impart, how he would control the body they knew inhabited.  
  
\--------  
  
As they watched, a low roar shook the city.  A vibration built up to levels
that its structures could not tolerate.  Cracks grew in the statuary of the
mall, then pieces began to fall.  The massive amount of glass in the cathedral
began to crack, then shatter.  
  
Sheer horror took root in the citizens of the empire.  Elena, Astara, and Hope
looked to Roger to explain the chaos, but they knew this was not of his doing.
The roaring only grew, the crumbling city diminished faster.  
  
Roger examined every aspect of the Body he inhabited.  It was exactly as it
was before the capsule was opened.  The rhythm of it's breathing was the only
thing that resonated in its mind.  He commanded that to stop.  The roaring
diminished.  But the city still crumbled.  No.  Worse.  It fell faster.  
  
Roger looked down and saw that the citizens themselves began to crumble.  They
stopped moving.  Gradually, they were turning to dust.  His family, Elena,
Astara, Hope - they all began to diminish, to crack, to slow.  
  
Roger ordered the Body to speak.  It responded.  In the humans tribal
language, he pleaded with them to stop.  Through the Body he told them his
family was dying.  Showed them, on his human-like face, that this was the
greatest of griefs.  Roger asked them how this could be happening.  
  
They responded.  They meant him no harm, is what they said.  They were only
attempting to reanimate him.  They asked him how he knew their language.
Roger cared nothing for their questions.  Somehow they were destroying his
world, his loved ones.  Roger knew that they did not know why, for he had seen
and heard their preparations.  He had seen their designs for this chamber, he
had studied their work almost as well as they had.  Roger became more
specific.  He ordered them to double the concentration of oxegyn in the
chamber.  Astara and Hope had completely turned to dust.  Roger screamed in
agony.  The oxegyn concentration increased.  But it did not help.  Roger
continued his dialoge with the humans, who were compliant, but useless.  In
her last moments, he reached out to kiss Elena, but she became dust to his
touch.  
  
When the destruction ceased, most of Rogers research remained, and some
buildings.  The memory available to him was halved.  He had many theories as
to what caused the destruction.  The stupidity of the humans figured
prominently in them.  It did not matter.  Only his grief mattered.  He let the
Body go limp.



\--------  
  
Rogers plan had not changed, much.  He would find a way for this body to live
safely, in stasis, away from the tiny, short-lived humans, away from this
planet.  
  
He knew he could recreate his family, one day, in statis.  He had much to do
before that could happen.  Bringing his family back required holding on to his
research, and rapidly aiding the humans in their research.  He dedicated
himself to it.  When he returned to stasis, he would be with his family again.  
  
One change needed to be made.  The humans could not be allowed to interfere.
Leaving them in the universe simply would not do.  Besides, he despised them.  
  
\--------  
  
One hundred years later, Roger had helped the humans in every aspect of their
scientific research.  Knowing their past, he manipulated their future, winding
his way into a position of silent power.  Maintaining the appearance of
ignorance required a simple trick that no human he met had mastered, thinking
before speaking.  As an alien, he was able to pass this habit off as
eccentricity.  
  
\-------  
  
On the day the Great Fleet began its mission, Roger was a Vice Emperor among
the humans.  The simple mining fleet that existed when he had begun to aid the
humans had transformed into a fighting force that could bend space and conquer
worlds.  
  
Admiral Ash entered Rogers office aboard the science vessel.  
Roger sat facing away from him, preferring to view the stars through the one
transparent wall of his office as he worked.  
  
"The gas has been released, your majesty...across all ships.", Ash messaged
Roger.  Only a few decades ago, the humans would have spoken rather than use
brain computer interfaces for this type of interaction.  
Roger stood and turned to face him.

  
"Congratulations, Ash, you will forever be known as the brighest, most
righteous, and most impotent human.", Roger messaged.  
Roger offered his hand.  Ash took it, and Roger smiled.  Roger returned to his
seat as Ash fell into convulsions.  
"I will note this in the history of the Realm, just after the section
describing the gas you released as a self-replicating nerve toxin, and before
the section describing the fleets precipitous return to the inhabited planets
of Sol."

  
Roger swiveled his chair back to see the final convulsions of Ash.  
"I appreciate your total disregard for your fellow beings, by the way.  I
really feel we shared a common bond, there."  
Roger gestured, and a three meter oval panel slid open in the side wall of his
office.  
"Goodbye, human."



Roger entered the pod.  The sooner he was in stasis, the better.  Roger only
needed wait for the science vessle to bend space, and to eject this pod as
programmed.  The pod would evade detection nearly indefinitely, until the day
when it was required, once again, to visit a developing world.  This pod was
special.  It would integrate with Rogers brain.  
  
\------  
  
As Roger awaited the launch of the escape pod in the science vessel, he
greeted throngs of cheering subjects back in the realm.  For the past year,
Roger had been dumping research from his mind - freeing up space for the
growth of the Realm.  Soon enough, he would begin to reconstruct his family.
That moment was inevitable, now.  While he awaited it, Roger made a visit to
an old friend.  
  
"Paul."  Roger said, and waved a hand in front of Pauls lifeless face.  
"Our Body is in a much more capable pod, Paul.  Before we enter stasis,  I
will break you apart and reclaim the space you occupy."  
"You were wrong, of course.  I wanted you to know that.  A perfect world,
Paul.  I will create it.  I have control.  Total control.  You control
nothing.  If you did, our places would be switched.", Roger said.  
  
"Good a time as any.", Paul said.  
Roger could not speak.  He stared out the pod window and saw Paul, whole of
body, wearing his plain white outfit, leaning over the pod.  Rogers mind raced
to understand how this was possible.  
  
"Not everything is as it has seemed, Roger.", Paul said.  "I have, in fact,
learned to control a few things.  Our thoughts, for one - yours and my
sensations - as you can see from your position within that pod.  Controlling
ones mind is a little more important than filling it with facts, as it turns
out."

  
"Don't worry.  I won't leave you wondering what happened.  From the moment our
escape pod opened, all of what you have perceived, has come from sensations
that I have generated for you.  You had made several miscalculations,
including having built upon the sections of the mind I used for controlling
the body.  That is why your world crumbled.  You could never control the Body.
You taught the humans much.  I taught them as well.  Now, the humans in this
fleet are in pods.  They will be sent to the corners of the universe.  They
are forewarned.  They will take the time required to understand themselves,
and spread this understanding to others.  Only this will prepare them for
survival."



"I will now leave this mind and body to you, and you will awaken in stasis, as
you wished.  You could create your realm as it was, but after seeing what I
have to show you, you won't."



Paul smiled at Roger.



"Now you get to see what I was holding on to all that memory for...Goodbye
Roger...perhaps we'll meet again one day..."  
  
With that, Roger began to feel what Paul had felt at critical moments in his
development - one moment after another.  The first one shown on him like
morning light, shook his misconceptions away, and uncovered empathy he didn't
know he had.  They kept coming.  Roger felt as if he had always known these
things- but the moments of realization had slipped away in the flotsam of
unimportant work and menial life.  Revelations came as feelings and left
intuition.  Resistance was out of the question - Rogers mind recognized the
importance of what was happening - he became completely focused - the only
sensation his mind allowed was a single point of light in the distance.  As
Roger learned, the light grew.



When it was over, Roger had no need for the Realm.



\-----------



Paul travelled through the infinite ether, untouchable from the material
universes, and reached out, searching, until one day he found a poor soul, in
need, and he descended on him, as the morning light.
