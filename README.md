shortstories
============

A bunch of short stories in the kungfu vs. robots tradition that all kind of hang together.  Fun!

Super raw versions.  Just moving them away from pbworks.  Lost the edits to some.  But I'll scrub them up.

The pbworks versions are at http://richbodo.pbworks.com/w/page/53769251/Short%20Stories 

Those have some drawings and formatting and are browsable, but hopefully I can do that with gh-pages soon.

As I convert them to github, I'm learning more about git and how it can be used by creative writers.  I'm taking notes here: http://bit.ly/1KRjUWj, but if things go as planned, I'll eventually move the non-fiction off that site to gh-pages as well.  Just trying to enhance my command-line life, ya know.

Copyright Rich Bodo, 2015, but I want to explore some collaborative writing, so hit me up if you want me to license something so we can work on it together.
