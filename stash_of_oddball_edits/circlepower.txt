You are circling an unknown, looking into it, looking away from it, telling yourself you are closing in on it.

There is a fear that prevents you from ever seriously considering leaping in, simply accepting it.

When you are in pain, things seem more real.  outside this circle, things are more real.

The unknown you suspect is a tremendous power.  real or not, it can change your universe completely. faith can do that.

Is it good or is it evil?  why would anyone jump into that unknown?

If it is not real, then it is exactly as you see, nothing.  

An unknown, ready to be transformed into a faith.  That scares you a bit, too.

You tell yourself you will close in on this thing, an inch at a time, through study and preparation.

No great mind was made in a day.  On the day you dive in, you must be prepared to believe in something good, a faith that you can be proud to be a part of, a faith that you understand, a faith of good will for ALL. 

But perhaps this thing will close in on you?  Know your principles and hold them close.  So much is unknowable to man.
