No, you are not going to "take it" or "attack it".

The skill you are looking for is the ability to redirect power.

Nature is impossibly strong.

It is throwing a very powerful attack at you, and you can neither hope to avoid or absorb it.

You will either be obliterated by it, or you will redirect it.
